# AWS Advanced Network Specialty Repository

Repository to store terraform code used while studying for the ANS-C01 exam. I am using Adrian Cantrill's [AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Specialty](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-advanced-networking-specialty) course to study for the exam. The course does provide CloudFormation stacks for a number of the demos, but I thought it would be ~~fun~~ challenging to recreate ~~all~~ some of the CloudFormation stacks with terraform code.
